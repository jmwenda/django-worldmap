Description: # GeoNode Client
        
        This is the javascript client part of GeoNode.
        
        
        ## Debug Mode
        
        Loads all scripts uncompressed.
        
            ant init
            ant debug
        
        This will give you an application available at http://localhost:8080/ by
        default.  You only need to run `ant init` once (or any time dependencies
        change).
        
        Note that http://localhost:8080/index.html is just a "Hello World" to
        see if everything is configured correctly. This project is not intended to run
        standalone. Instead, it is meant to be used by GeoNode. To make GeoNode use it
        instead of the static, minified JavaScript resources, make your GeoNode's
        src/GeoNodePy/geonode/local_settings.py point to it:
        
            GEONODE_CLIENT_LOCATION = "http://localhost:8080/"
        
        
        ## Prepare App for Deployment
        
        To create a zip with the minified application run the following:
        
            ant zip
        
        The archive will be assembled in the build directory. GeoNode's
        setup_geonode_client paver task expects this zip to be available at
        http://dev.geonode.org/dev-data/geonode-client.zip for the master branch, and
        http://dev.geonode.org/dev-data/synth/geonode-client.zip for the synth branch.
        
        For now, since we don't have a post-commit hook yet that automatically updates
        these resources, if you are a core developer with access to dev.geonode.org,
        please copy the most recent geonode-client.zip to
        /var/www/dev.geonode.org/htdocs/dev-data/(synth/) after a commit.
